# THE NARCOTIX ENGINE
This is just a C99 and OpenGL-based API I've written for the purpose of developing 3D first person shooter games. It is still HEAVILY under work, and probably won't be reasonably usable until it's flagship release "Hungover" comes out, which will let me know what featues I want to add to the engine as well as fixing a lot of bugs I may not have even considered yet.

So far, some things that I plan to implement are:
* Skeletal Animation
* PBR Rendering
* Shadow Mapping
* In-Game Cutscenes
