This is just a C99 and Open\+GL-\/based API I\textquotesingle{}ve written for the purpose of developing 3D first person shooter games. It is still HEAVILY under work, and probably won\textquotesingle{}t be reasonably usable until it\textquotesingle{}s flagship release \char`\"{}\+Hungover\char`\"{} comes out, which will let me know what featues I want to add to the engine as well as fixing a lot of bugs I may not have even considered yet.

So far, some things that I plan to implement are\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Skeletal Animation
\item PBR Rendering
\item Shadow Mapping
\item In-\/\+Game Cutscenes 
\end{DoxyItemize}
